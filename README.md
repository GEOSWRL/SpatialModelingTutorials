# SpatialModelingTutorials
SpatialModelingTutorials was developed to demonstrate function modeing, batch processing, and raster_tools functionality, along with various other coding and modelling strategies.

This collection of Notebooks are meant to demonstrate spatial modeling techniques that use parallel processing and the newly developed [Raster Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) package. All notebooks are designed to run within Google's Colab. However, they can also be used locally if [Raster Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) in properly installed on the local machine.

To open a notebook within Colab expand the Notebooks directory and click on a given notebook. After the notebook opens in GitHub click on the “Open in Colab” link (top left). Once in Colab you can step through each notebook cell.

Check back regularly for new Notebooks!
